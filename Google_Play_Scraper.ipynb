However, my daughter found this and felt I would enjoy it because of penguins and the calming music playing in the background. Both my daughters and I play it when we have some downtime or waiting-in-the-car type stuff. Also, the creators keep it fresh and alive, seasonal fun stuff to collect, mini-games to get more goodies, and updates to add more interactive things (like adding neighbors, etc). Love it!\",\n",

Also research tiers, I'm stuck at level 27 and waiting for 28 to become available after waiting months for number 27 to begin with. In my opinion they should go for unlimited tiers.\",\n",

The other habitats take on average 172 times longer for an upgrade to pay for itself than the first two habitats. This is calculated after upgrading all the 17 habitats so that all their upgrade costs are in the range 178bf to 184bf gold, and their evolution costs are all 1o hearts except the flower farm which is 2o hearts (because it always costs double the others to evolve at any given price scale).

I have a suggestion though, it would be great if penguins could switch: let's say, one penguin is a fisherman from the very beginning of a game. I know, I know it's not the real life, bit wouldn't it be awesome if they were changing jobs with other penguins? Those 15 folks are working tooth and nail, and the other ones and just chilling? I think it would be great if they had some kind of shifts, so like, they switch, the fisherman takes a break, then another penguin comes to switch, etc.\",\n",

One of my favorite features is the decorative freedom, helping influence your waddly buddies world. The events have kept me motivated to improve their home! I find myself building things faster than I can dig up room for, i love having an interactive environment. Needless to say, this game has motivated a shocking addiction for me. I am excited for future events to lead us into a world of personal beauty! I have a personal interest in a Medieval Island, for our pink dragon and his magical friends, A purple stone tower with a bearded magician making yummy spells. Dare I say we have a night to chase off the pink friend we have now! Conjuring up some wonderful ideas!',\n",
